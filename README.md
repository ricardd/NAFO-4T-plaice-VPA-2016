# NAFO-4T-plaice-VPA-2016
Git repository for the NAFO 4T 2016 American plaice assessment. The VPA is implemented in AD Model Builder.

This repository contains the files required to replicate the VPA used in the 2016 assessment of NAFO 4T American plaice. Mostly created to be shared with colleagues in the Newfoundland and Labrador Region of DFO that are interested in implementing a similar assessment methodology which estimates time-varying natural mortality.
