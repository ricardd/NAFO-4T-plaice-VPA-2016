This repository contains the files required to replicate the VPA used in the 2016 assessment of NAFO 4T American plaice. Mostly created to be shared with colleagues in the Newfoundland and Labrador Region of DFO that are interested in implementing a similar assessment methodology with varying natural mortality.
